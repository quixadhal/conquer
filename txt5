                           SCORING & CHARACTER CLASSES

Each nation has a types (class), which is chosen when it it is created, and
which determines how Victory points are received.  Some classes start with
powers and have a starting cost. Warlord/Monster powers get all prerequisite
powers, and thus starting cost can varies.

Nations can get points by having large values in their important national
attributes.  This bonus to scoring is calculated as follows.

                               LEADERS

Leader units represent individual leaders and may not be merged or joined
with other leader units.

Leaders are born (randomly created), not summoned or drafted.  A new
leader will be placed in the owning players capitol.  Leader types
are created based on a nations class based on the table on the next page.
They can move at double speed and ignore enemy zones of control.  They
can not, however, capture land.  They work by the same rules that magic
monsters do... if they take damage in combat, there is a percent chance 
that they will be killed.  A leader is required to be in the same sector
for an army to move at full movement rate (if no leader is present, the
unit can move only half as far).  Leaders are the foundations of army
groups, and armies in a group move at +2 sectors per turn, and fight
at +20% in all combats.

                        LOSING YOUR NATIONAL LEADER

If you lose your nations leader, your nation is thrown into chaos.  None of
your armies can move for the turn (this works for npcs too).  There is a
30% chance per turn that your nation is restored to normalcy (a new leader
ascends to the throne... and you get your nations leader back).  This
is a disaster to your country and is designed to knock you out of the
game for a few turns (after all - losing your king is a BIG deal).  Minor
leaders are reborn at a good clip, but you should guard them because they
are important to your ability to wage war.

Note that birth rates given on the last table are per year (not per turn).

                          EXOTIC TRADE GOODS
  
Special products, or exotic trade goods, are another way to customize
your nation.  Many sectors have the ability to produce these goods...
it is your choice to redesignate these sectors so as to be able to use
them.  The goods in a sector are listed as "special: ?????" on the
right hand side of the screen.  There are 5 levels of exotic trade
goods. Each requires prerequisite values in the nation attribute they
shall effect. If you don't have the prerequisite, you don't even know
that the good exists (surprise).
  
Exotic Trade Goods are distributed to sectors at the beginning of the
game, and don't change.  Each sector has XTRADEPCT% chance of having an
exotic trade good.  Goods are random distributed based on the goods
value (a value 5 good occurs 1/5th as often as value 1 good).  Any
sector can have any good except:

corn,fruit - food value > 6                   fish - next to water
timber,pine,oak - wood/forest

They add ( value * sect_pop / 1000) to your nations attributes as follows:

There are approximately 60 different trade goods.  They affects specific 
national attributes WHEN the sector they are in has the correct designation.  
The following lists the value, designation needed, and nation attribute 
changed for each trade good.  Thus, an wool sector designated as a farm 
produces 3 points of popularity.  Special display and redesignation options

All nation attributes range from 0 to 100 except for eatrate, spoilrate,
and communications.  The base figures stated below are just that.  These 
values may be modified by random events and by trade goods.

tax rate     Each player can control their tax rate.  This number directly
                impacts your revenue, but lowers your governments popularity 
                and increases the chances of a revolt.  Anything over
                15% pretty much lose you the game when your nation revolts.
prestige     National prestige.  Lowers chance of military revolts.
popularity   Modifies the chance of peasant revolts.  You get one added
             point of popularity for each sector you take.
power        Relative power of your nation.
END
                          NATION ATTRIBUTES          pg. 2

communications  Effects leader range ( to keep units at full movement ).
wealth          How wealthy is your nation
eatrate         How much food each civilian can eat each turn.  This is
                a value in terms of food per civilian person.  
storerate       How much food per civilian you can store each turn.
knowledge       Knowledge of the arts and sciences in your nation.
farm ability    How good are you at farming.
mine ability    How good are you at mining.
poverty         Percent of the nation that cant eat, live, or be merry.  
terror          How scared people are of you. Lowers chance of revolts.
reputation      How well liked is your nation.

                FORMULAE USED FOR NATION ATTRIBUTES          pg. 1

The formulae used to compute national attributes are listed on the next
page.  Values are stored in an unsigned character (0 to 256).  One real
point of communications range is gained for each 50 points of
communications, and one point of eatrate and store rate are gained per 25
points.  Other variables are normal.  Aggressiveness (see below) is gained
when you change diplomatic status, and become more hostile to a nation than
they are with you.  Thus, if you are neutral with phonos, and they are
hostile to you, you lose nothing by going hostile with them, but accrue 1
point of aggressiveness by going to war with them, and 2 by going on a
jihad.  Aggressiveness points accrue doubled when against a nation of the
same race as you.

poverty     : is funny.  You can give charity to the poor to lower the poverty
              rate but the equilibrium level with no charity will be about
              100-wealth/4.  Charity is a user paramter, which indicates the
              percent of your NET income to go to the poor.  Giving twice your
              population in talons will reduce poverty by one.

                                REVOLTS

Revolts are the worst thing that can happen to your nation.  Revolts
occur based on the following formulae:

probability of peasant revolt  = 10*tax_rate - popularity - terror - 3*charity
probability of military revolt = 5*tax_rate - prestige

Revolts only occur when a nation has more than 20 sectors and a
score > 20.  To prevent abuse of this "charity" the maximum tax_rate
before this time is 10%.
